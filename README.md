## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

### Continued development

I'd like to develop on my CSS3 and finally move on to Javascript

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand HTML and CSS basics. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
